# Infested Allay XP Farm

This is an xp farm design which uses the infestation potion on allays together with a suffocation damage to spawn silverfish which can easily killed for xp. Because allays regenrate health faster then they receive from the suffocation, they never need to be healed.

I heard about this from a fiend and decided to look for some designs online. I found Sir James Ender's design, but decided to change some things and created (in my opinion) a prettier interface and implemented some extra features. (But for a more detailed explanation how this works, check out his video)

## Minimum version

The minimum version just has the suffocation damage trigger (yellow), the infestation potion activator (light blue) and the simple lever trash bin (orange).

## Extra features

There are 3 extra features you can add. 2 of these features require some extra circuits.

### Button for trash bin (orange circuit)

Instead of a lever to activate and deactivate, there is also the option to use a button with an extended pulse. So you never forget to reset the lever.

### Duration indicator (green circuit)

This is an indicator to show how long the infestation potion should last. This is not completely accurate, because splashing a potion from a dispenser on multiple mobs is never fully accurate, but it will be accurate to a few seconds.

Requires the blue and cyan circuits.

### Potion indicator (purple circuit)

This is an indicator to show if there is at least one (1) potion left in the system.

Requires the blue circuit.
